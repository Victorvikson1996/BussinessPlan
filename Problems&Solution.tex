\section{3. Problem and Solution}

\subsection*{Problems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Charging Deserts:} 60\% of rural EU regions lack public chargers, stifling EV adoption.
    \item \textbf{Slow Charging:} 70\% of existing chargers operate below 50kW, requiring 1+ hours for a full charge.
    \item \textbf{Fragmented Networks:} Drivers use 5+ apps to navigate competing providers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Solutions}
\textbf{Ultra-Fast Chargers:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 150kW+ Stations reduce charging time to 20--30 minutes (vs. 1+ hours for 50kW chargers).
    \item \textit{Battery Buffering:} On-site batteries ensure consistent power delivery during peak demand.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Strategic Coverage:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 50\% of Stations deployed in underserved rural areas (e.g., Andalusia, Bavaria).
    \item \textit{Urban Hubs:} Partnerships with shopping malls (e.g., Carrefour) for high-traffic locations.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Unified Platform:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Single app for payments, route planning, and energy optimization.
    \item \textit{Fleet API:} Custom dashboards for logistics companies to monitor charging costs in real time.
\end{itemize}
